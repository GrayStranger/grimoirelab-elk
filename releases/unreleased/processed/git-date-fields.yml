title: Define date format for Git documents
category: changed

notes: |
  Git by default uses a custom date format
  that is not recognized by Elastic/OpenSearch.

  Specify the format for the AuthorDate and
  CommitDate fields in Git documents to support
  the formats usually returned by `git log`.

  This allows us to do proper filtering on
  these fields such as "all documents with
  CommitDate before 2020".
