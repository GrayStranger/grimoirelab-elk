title: Update support for ES/OS versions > 7.X/1.X
category: changed

issue: null
notes: |
  Currently the support for ES/OS versions > 7.X/1.X
  is broken due to a faulty version check.

  Add a static method to the Elasticsearch object
  that correctly checks whether the version
  is 'legacy' (defined as ES 6.X or OS 0.X) and
  adds this check to various places in the codebase.

  Additionally, fixes an instance where `interval` is
  used instead of `fixed_interval`. `interval` was
  deprecated in ES7.
