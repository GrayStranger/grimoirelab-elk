title: Enrichment processing time reduced by 50%
category: performance

notes: |
  The general performance was improved reducing the number of calls
  to the identities manager (i.g. `SortingHat`). There were some deprecated
  calls that weren't needed any longer and also, we increased the cache of
  individuals in ELKs.
  We were also able to reduce the processing time of the Git backend by
  converting commit dates only once.
